Meat ready in October or November depending on the weather. Please sign up in advance of October to ensure they are not already sold (email or call). Pig meat is meant to be seasonal (it&#39;s not ideal for pigs living outdoors in the middle of the winter in East Yorkshire as it is very wet) so sign up, fill your freezer and enjoy top quality meat. They are Saddleback x British Lop which is meant to give a very good quality of meat. They will not be too fat as are living outside and spend a lot of time cantering around their paddock. Our pig&#39;s happiness is our number 1 concern &#045; they are fed vegetables every day, we dig a mud wallow for them as natural sunblock and they have a straw bale shed as a house and a hedge to hide in when it is hot. Even the pigs breeder came to see them and said they were extremely happy pig They will go to the local butcher, only a few miles away, not a large abattoir and after having lived at least 6 months of pig heaven. Visitors very welcome at any time just give me a call before you come for Health & Safety reasons 07909 905233.",

The pigs at The Oak Tree Farm are a vital part of the cultivation process. They work as a &#39;pig tractor ploughing up areas of the land as they root around, removing the roots of the perrenial weeds such as couch grass as they do so. Meanwhile, very fertile pig poo is returned to the soil, completing the cycle. They are fantastic animals to have on the farm, and have an exceptional quality of life.",
